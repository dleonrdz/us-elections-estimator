## Overview

The US Elections Tracker is an interactive web application built with Streamlit that visualizes political sentiment and electoral vote distribution across different states in the US. By analyzing tweets, we estimate the sentiment towards each party and compare it with official polls. This tool provides valuable insights into the political landscape and social media influence.

## Features

- **GeoPreferences**: Visualize the distribution of electoral votes across different states, including detailed insights into the Key States Battle.
- **Who's Winning?**: Compare the overall electoral votes each party has according to our sentiment estimation versus the official polls.
- **Tweets Wars**: Track the engagement metrics over time to see which party generates more buzz on social media.
- **Tweet-o-Meter**: Analyze the political inclination of your custom tweet and see how it aligns with current sentiment.
